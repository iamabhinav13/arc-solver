Overview
In this competition, youâ€™ll develop AI systems to efficiently learn new skills and solve open-ended problems, rather than depend exclusively on systems trained with extensive datasets. The top submissions will show improvement toward human level reasoning.

Merger & Entry
Description
Note: This is the second ARC Prize competition on Kaggle. It builds upon the ARC Prize 2024. This second competition has an updated dataset of human-calibrated problems and increased compute for participants.

Current AI systems can not generalize to new problems outside their training data, despite extensive training on large datasets. LLMs have brought AI to the mainstream for a large selection of known tasks. However, progress towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is idea constrained. Improvements in AGI could enable AI systems that think and invent alongside humans.

The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI-2) benchmark measures an AI system's ability to efficiently learn new skills. Humans have collectively scored 100% in ARC, whereas the best AI systems only score 4%. The ARC Prize competition encourages researchers to explore ideas beyond LLMs, which depend heavily on large datasets and struggle with novel problems.

This competition includes several components. The competition as described here carries a prize of $125,000 with an additional $600,000 available if any team can beat a score of 85% on the leaderboard. Further opportunities outside of Kaggle may also be available- to learn more visit ARCprize.org.

Your work could contribute to new AI problem-solving applicable across industries. Vastly improved AGI will likely reshape human-machine interactions. Winning solutions will be open-sourced to promote transparency and collaboration in the field of AGI.

Evaluation
This competition evaluates submissions on the percentage of correct predictions. For each task, you should make 2 attempts to predict the exact outputs for every test input grid contained in the task. (Tasks can have more than one test input that needs a predicted output.) Each task test output has one ground truth. For a given task output, any of the 2 predicted outputs matches the ground truth exactly, you score 1 for that task test output, otherwise 0. The final score is the sum averaged of the highest score per task output divided by the total number of task test outputs.

Submission File
The submission file for this competition must be a json named submission.json.

For each task output in the evaluation set, you should make exactly 2 predictions (attempt_1, attempt_2). The structure of predictions is shown below. Many tasks have multiple outputs (a multiple dictionaries enclosed in a list), although some tasks have a single output that must be predicted. When a task has multiple test outputs that need to be predicted (e.g., task 12997ef3 below), they must be in the same order as the corresponding test inputs.

IMPORTANT: All the task_ids in the input challenges json file must also be present in the submission.json file. Both "attempt_1" and "attempt_2" must be present, even if your submission doesn't have 2 predictions.
